## Introduction

Welcome to the 2nd iteration of **The WHAT THE Cup**! The tournament where
we give Nagraj money and take it back. This handbook outlines the
rules, format, and schedule for the competition. <<_please note that
the name of the tournament is The WHAT THE cup!. The starting “The” is
important. There is no cup._>>

# Timeline:

- _Registrations close_: **2025-05-01**
- _Tournament start_: **2025-05-04**
- _Group stages_: **May 5 - June 30**

# Eligibility and Sign-Up

- **ELO Requirement**: 100-1300 at the time of signup. The mysterious
  host will verify ELO and reserves the right to consider ELO history.
- **History**: _At least_ 10 ranked 1v1s within 1 month of sign up
  date need to be played. So between 2025-04-01 and 2025-05-01 (both
  inclusive), players should have played 10 games on the ranked ladder
  which lasted more than 5 mins.
- **Seed calculation**: `((current ELO * 0.75) + (peak ELO * 0.25))`
  giving a higher weightage to the player's current ELO
- Community can vote to add or subtract 50 elo based on known
  smurfiness/lameness of signed up players.
- **Signup**: Discord:
  https://discord.com/channels/833026720483115039/1111990203217887323
- **Host Discretion**: The host reserves the right to accept or deny
  player registrations due to excessive signups or other
  circumstances. Final say goes to Nagraj.
- **Max signups**: 8. <<signups will be closed if we receive more than
  12 entries and the hosts+admins will decide on which 8 to accept.>>
- **Signup cost**: FREE FREE!! Donations accepted.
- **Admins**: Deadmeatnoob

## Map drafts:

- **Map 1**: Lower Elo picks maps before the start of the
  week. Failure to do so will let the higher elo pick the map. Failure
  to do so will result in Nagraj’s fav map: Four lakes.
- **Map 2**: Lower Elo picks maps before the start of the week. It has
  to be different from Map 1. Failure to do so will let the higher elo
  pick the map. Failure to do so will result in Nagraj’s fav map:
  Shoals.

## Civ drafts:

Free civ pick. Repeating your own civ is not allowed.

# Group Stage

- **Match Format**: Play All 2
    - Lower Elo/Seed player selects both maps.
    - To be posted before the start of the week.
- **Scheduling**: Map needs to be posted at the start of the
  week. Scheduling should be done before the start of the
  week. Rescheduling possible.
- **Advance scheduling**: you can play future week's sets in advance
  and post recs.
- **Handicap**: Handicap is allowed. Suggested handicap is 5% for
  every 100 signup elo difference. Lower elo players can forgo the
  handicap if they feel cocky. Higher elo can offer higher handicap if
  they feel cocky.
- **Duration**: 8 weeks
- **Unplayed Matches**: Any match not played by the deadline will
  result in a loss for the player who failed to schedule or show
  up. If both players fail at it, shame on both of you.
- **FINE**: As there is no prize pool, there is no Fine. If someone
  donates for a prize pool we can implement a FINE system to encourage
  participation and proper scheduling.
- **Unfair practices**: Laming, including villager fighting, walling
  in resources, and taking/killing opponent hunt or herdables, is
  forbidden before minute 4 in-game
    - For nomad starts, if initial town centers are placed such that
      there is treaty zone overlap, the game is to be
      restarted. Taking cows and sheep allowed.
    - Town center drops (douching) is forbidden before minute 4, on
      any map.
    - Laming rules are in place to give players some time to check if
      a map has been generated correctly.
